# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and others) when working with code in this repository. It is the source of truth; the sibling `CLAUDE.md` imports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

It is the **monorepo orientation layer**: it maps the whole repo and points to the
module guides that own the depth. For anything inside a module, read that module's
guide rather than expecting full detail here:

- **[backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md)** — backend depth: harness/app split, agent &
  middleware chain, sandbox, MCP, skills, memory, IM channels, persistence/migrations,
  config system, test layout.
- **[frontend/AGENTS.md](frontend/AGENTS.md)** — frontend depth: Next.js App Router layout,
  thread/streaming data flow, code style, commands.

## What is DeerFlow

DeerFlow is a LangGraph-based AI super-agent system with a full-stack architecture. The
backend runs a "super agent" with sandboxed execution, persistent memory, subagent
delegation, and extensible tools (built-in, MCP, community), all per-thread isolated. The
frontend is a Next.js chat UI. External IM platforms (Feishu, Slack, Telegram, Discord,
DingTalk) bridge into the same agent through the Gateway.

## Service Topology

A single `make dev` / Docker stack runs four cooperating services:

| Service         | Port   | Role                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nginx**       | `2026` | Unified reverse-proxy entry point — open this in the browser        |
| **Gateway API** | `8001` | FastAPI REST API + embedded LangGraph-compatible agent runtime      |
| **Frontend**    | `3000` | Next.js web interface                                               |
| **Provisioner** | `8002` | Optional — only when sandbox is configured for provisioner/K8s mode |

Nginx is the single public entry: it serves the frontend and proxies `/api/langgraph/*`
to the Gateway's LangGraph runtime, rewriting it to Gateway's native `/api/*` routes; all
other `/api/*` go straight to the Gateway REST routers. See
[backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md) for the runtime and router detail.

## Repository Map

```
deer-flow/
├── Makefile                        # Root orchestration: drives the full stack (dev/start/stop, docker, setup)
├── config.example.yaml             # Template → copy to config.yaml (gitignored) at repo root
├── extensions_config.example.json  # Template → copy to extensions_config.json (gitignored): MCP servers + skills
├── backend/                        # Python backend — see backend/AGENTS.md
│   ├── Makefile                    # Per-module backend commands (dev, gateway, test, lint, migrate-rev)
│   ├── packages/harness/           # deerflow-harness package (import: deerflow.*) — agent framework
│   └── app/                        # FastAPI Gateway + IM channels + app-only services such as report_compare (import: app.*)
├── frontend/                       # Next.js frontend (pnpm) — see frontend/AGENTS.md
├── docker/                         # docker-compose files, nginx config, provisioner
├── skills/                         # Agent skills: public/ (committed), custom/ (gitignored)
├── contracts/                      # Cross-component JSON contracts (e.g. subagent status)
├── scripts/                        # Root orchestration scripts invoked by the Makefile (check, configure, doctor, support_bundle, serve, nginx, docker, deploy, setup_wizard)
├── tests/                          # Root-level tests (currently tests/skills/ — public skill tests)
└── docs/                           # Cross-cutting docs, plans, and design notes
```

Runtime config lives at the **repo root**: copy `config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml`
(main app config) and `extensions_config.example.json` → `extensions_config.json` (MCP
servers + skills). Both real files are gitignored and may be edited at runtime via the
Gateway API. Config schema and resolution order are documented in
[backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md).

## Commands: Root vs. Module

**Root `make` targets drive the whole stack** (run from the repo root):

```bash
make setup       # Interactive setup wizard (recommended for new users)
make doctor      # Check configuration and system requirements
make support-bundle  # Generate redacted troubleshooting summary, AI issue draft, and optional zip
make config      # Generate local config files from the examples
make check       # Check that required tools are installed
make install     # Install all dependencies (frontend + backend + pre-commit hooks)
make dev         # Start all services with hot-reload (Gateway + Frontend + Nginx)
make start       # Start all services in production mode (local, optimized)
make stop        # Stop all running services
make up / down   # Build/stop the production Docker stack (browser at localhost:2026)
make docker-start / docker-stop / docker-logs   # Docker development environment
```

Run `make help` for the full list.

**Per-module commands drive a single module** (run inside that module):

```bash
# Backend (see backend/AGENTS.md for the full set)
cd backend && make dev        # Gateway API with reload (port 8001)
cd backend && make test       # Backend test suite
cd backend && make lint       # ruff check
cd backend && make format     # ruff format

# Frontend (see frontend/AGENTS.md for the full set)
cd frontend && pnpm dev       # Dev server with Turbopack (port 3000)
cd frontend && pnpm check     # Lint + type check (run before committing)
cd frontend && pnpm test      # Unit tests
```

Rule of thumb: **root `make` = the full application**; **`backend/Makefile` and `frontend/`
(`pnpm`) = per-module work.**

## Where to Go Next

- Backend work → **[backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md)**
- Frontend work → **[frontend/AGENTS.md](frontend/AGENTS.md)**
- Setup & install → **[Install.md](Install.md)**, **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**
- Project overview & usage → **[README.md](README.md)** (translations: `README_zh.md`,
  `README_ja.md`, `README_fr.md`, `README_ru.md`)
- Security policy → **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**
- Changes → **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**

## Cross-Cutting Conventions

These apply repo-wide; module guides own the module-specific detail.

- **Documentation update policy** — keep docs in sync with code: update `README.md` for
  user-facing changes and the relevant `AGENTS.md` for development/architecture changes in
  the same change set.
- **Test-driven development** — features and bug fixes ship with tests. Backend tests live
  in `backend/tests/` (TDD is mandatory there; see [backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md));
  frontend tests live in `frontend/tests/`.
- **Format before pushing** — run `make format` (backend) / `pnpm check` (frontend). Backend
  CI enforces `ruff format --check`, so formatting must be clean before a push.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **cafe-deer-flow** (35305 symbols, 55189 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
